Error Boundaries: Implement error boundaries to catch runtime errors in the UI components and display fallback UI gracefully.
Loading States: Add loading states for when data is being fetched or when authentication is in progress.
Context for Menus: If the menu list grows in complexity, consider managing the menus in a global context for easier updates across the app.
Testing: Add unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure components are working as expected
Global Error Boundaries: For better error handling, wrap the app with an error boundary to catch any unexpected UI errors.
Loading State Enhancement: Instead of using a loading spinner inside the button, consider using a global loading indicator (e.g., a full-screen spinner) for better UX.
